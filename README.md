# OpenQR
Welcome to OpenQR, a simple and open-source self-hosted QR code processor. This project was initially created as a demonstration for my team, highlighting how straightforward it is to explore new technologies or libraries, implement a small-scale demo, come up with an appealing name, and then open-source the project. In this README, I'll provide an overview of the project's journey and key features.

## Background
OpenQR was developed to showcase the implementation of state machines using XState and Stately for efficient state management. The project served as an educational tool to illustrate how state machines can simplify complex UI behaviors.

## Features

### Offline Capability
OpenQR comes as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and is fully functional even without an internet connection. This feature underscores the versatility and accessibility of the application.

## #Safety and Security
One of the project's focal points was ensuring user safety and security. The QR code processing takes place directly on the user's device, preventing automatic opening of links. This design choice promotes user control and privacy. Moreover, the decision to make the project open-source further underscores the commitment to transparency and security.

### User-Friendly Design
OpenQR boasts an intuitive icon-based user interface that minimizes textual elements, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize the application without language barriers.


## Technologies

- Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
- Using [Nimiq's QR Scanner](https://github.com/nimiq/qr-scanner)
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) and [Stately](https://stately.ai/) for state management.

## License
OpenQR is freely distributable under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/ItayLisaey/safeview/blob/main/LICENSE).

## OpenQR stands as a testament to how rapidly new technologies and libraries can be explored, integrated, and demonstrated through small-scale projects. It not only showcased the capabilities of state machines but also emphasized the importance of user experience, security, and open-source collaboration. This project journey serves as an inspiration for future endeavors that combine learning, innovation, and community involvement.
